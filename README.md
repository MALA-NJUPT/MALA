Professor YunyunWang, School of Computer, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications
- Our team's research method is Machine Learning and Adaptation, which is committed to pushing the frontier of artificial intelligence. Our research focuses on developing and improving machine learning algorithms, which includes but is not limited to unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, domain adaptation, and domain generalization methods. We encourage team members to actively participate in various journal conferences, share the latest research results with all researchers, and establish a wide range of academic collaborations. We always believe that with continuous efforts, our technology and research will be able to bring positive impact to the field of artificial intelligence.
- Under this project, we will open source the experimental code in the journal and conference literature.
